								<b>Explainable Pathfinding for Inscrutable Planners with Inductive Logic Programming</b><br><b>Summary:</b>
								<br>By combining inductive logic programming (ILP) with a given inscrutable planner, we constructed an explainable graph representing solutions to all states in the state space. 
								This graph can then be summarized using a variety of methods such as hierarchical representations or simple if/else rules. 
								We tested our approach on Towers of Hanoi.
